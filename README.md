# 🚖 Taxi Fare Prediction Project  

This project aims to predict taxi fares using **machine learning techniques**. By analyzing historical taxi fare data, we develop a model that estimates fares based on various factors such as distance, time, and location details.

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset includes comprehensive details to build a robust fare prediction model. It is available [here](https://github.com/aravindsreekumar28/TaxiFare-Forecast/blob/main/Datasets/Raw.csv).  

### ✨ Key Features in the Dataset  

- **📅 Pickup and Dropoff Times:** Account for traffic patterns during different times of the day.  
- **📍 Geographical Coordinates:** Essential for calculating distances and estimating fares.  
- **📏 Distance:** A primary predictor of fare, derived from pickup and dropoff coordinates.  
- **👥 Additional Factors:** Includes passenger count, vendor ID, and other fields for enhanced accuracy.
